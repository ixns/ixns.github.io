## Why this is worth listening to
This song, which is essentially just a poem, is a short reflection on our postmodern society. George hotz often touts Infinite Jest as
a 'life-changing' novel. I believe that book is what mostly inspires this song. If you liked that book, you'll enjoy this song.

## The lyrics
It was the crisp chilly night after a child's first Christmas. Barren streets safe for a small crowd gathered outside a boutique electronics store, listening to the man on the screen deliver a soliloquy about how bad it is going to get, interspersed with advertisements for Snuggies, Cocoa, and Geico.
As the first flake fall we embrace in a Wallgreens parking lot, armed with only our persons and tattered tech-company hoodies, and with you pressed up
against me my ever-present companion, the racing inner monologue, gives way to the calm control of coming up on Adderall and realizing we are in
a city of millions where nobody knows us, and we can just dissapear and blend into the aether like radio waves and no one will give us a second thought.
We make our way into a coffee shop where we huddle together around a pumpkin spice latte, not knowing how much longer this is going to last but in
this moment not really caring, we think therefore we are, and no one is omnipent yet, so let's vanish into the cracks of sidewalks, drink from the
Hudson river, and eat the remnants of a civilization where people would continue to stare at their phones while the hydrogen bombs detonate above
them, and the sky is blacked out so they download a flashlight app, and make a dull-witted comment about how Obama should fix the sun on
Facebook
We as people who aren't built for this world why should we have to play by it's arbitrary rules. Can I get a show of hands of people who still think
the industrial revolution was a good idea?
We've dug ourseleves into a hole and instead of trying to push the dirt back in we build dumptrucks to cart it away, excavators to dig it deeper,
drills to get throught the bedrock and lasers to oblate the diamonds while we run ad campaigns to push the shiny rocks on soon-to-be brides fingers.
Is it okay that we've built a society where 13% of people are on antidepressants
Maybe it's time to rethink the hole; sure, the hole had your smartphones and flush toilets in it, but it also had heroin, Twitter, drones and
nuclear missiles, and we're digging more frantically then ever, and no one is smart enough to know what lies just a little further ahead, nevermind if we
finally break through to the other side where the world is so upside down that we'll literally have to lose ourselves to live in it, so maybe we
should just stop fucking digging it.
but then of course the unions would uproar, and without the hole what would society do all day, and of course there would some kid who thinks the
hole is the greatest thing ever, and sneaks down with a shovel at night just to move a little more dirt out of the way, and enlists his friends to
carry buckets of dirt
and the dirt is far to scattered to ever fill the hole up anyway so why should we even try
let's just sit, and sip our joint latte.
and when its done step into the night and hold each other as wallflowers with the storm rolling in, as people hustle and bustle by looking like they are going somewhere
and if anyone bothered noticing us, we'd be the freaks for just standing there.
